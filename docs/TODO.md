# Sentry Integration Issues Resolution Summary

## Overview
This task involved resolving multiple issues related to Sentry integration in the Nexus TechHub Next.js project. The key problems addressed include:

- Environment variable inconsistencies between `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_DSN`.
- Duplicate Sentry initialization concerns.
- Missing integration of the ErrorBoundary component with Sentry for production error capture.
- Hydration errors on the test page caused by server/client content mismatch.

## Changes Made
- Standardized environment variables to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` primarily, with fallback to `SENTRY_DSN`.
- Consolidated Sentry initialization in `pages/_app.js` and `lib/third-party-services.js`.
- Enhanced `components/ErrorBoundary.js` to capture exceptions with Sentry in production.
- Fixed hydration errors on `pages/test.js` by rendering client-only content after hydration.
- Verified Sentry configuration and rendering of the Sentry test component on the test page.

## Testing
- Verified environment variable consistency and Sentry configuration on the test page.
- Confirmed rendering and availability of the SentryTestButton component.
- Fixed hydration errors to prevent React warnings.
- User opted to skip thorough event capture testing.

## Recommendations
- Monitor Sentry dashboard for error/event capture.
- Use the SentryTestButton component on the test page to trigger test events as needed.
- Maintain environment variable consistency in deployment environments.
- Ensure ErrorBoundary is used to wrap critical components for error reporting.

## Status
All identified Sentry integration issues have been resolved. The project is now properly configured for reliable error reporting and monitoring in production.

Task is complete.

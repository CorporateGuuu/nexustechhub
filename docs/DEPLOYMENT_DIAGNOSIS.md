- ❌ Nexus TechHub branding missing
- ❌ UAE phone number not showing
- ❌ AED currency not displaying
- ❌ Webhook endpoint returning 400 errors

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis**

**Primary Issue**: Environment variables have NOT been added to Netlify yet.

**Evidence**:
1. API endpoints returning 400/404 errors
2. Stripe integration not detected in page content
3. Business information (phone, branding) not showing
4. Webhook endpoint failing signature verification

**Impact**: The website structure is deployed, but dynamic functionality is broken.

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Netlify (CRITICAL - 10 minutes)**

**Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/ → Sites → nexustechhub → Site settings → Environment variables

**Add these variables exactly as shown**:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=***
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET]
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://nexustechhub.netlify.app
BUSINESS_NAME=Nexus Tech Hub
BUSINESS_EMAIL=admin@nexustechhub.ae
BUSINESS_PHONE=+971585531029
BUSINESS_WHATSAPP=https://wa.me/971585531029
BUSINESS_CURRENCY=AED
BUSINESS_COUNTRY=AE
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=[YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY]
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=[YOUR_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY]
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:${BUSINESS_EMAIL}
```

### **Step 2: Trigger New Deployment (CRITICAL - 3 minutes)**

**After adding ALL environment variables**:
1. Go to: Deploys tab in Netlify
2. Click: "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
3. Wait: 3-5 minutes for deployment to complete

### **Step 3: Verify Fixed Deployment (5 minutes)**

**Run verification after new deployment**:
```bash
node Scripts/comprehensive-site-check.js
```

**Expected Results After Fix**:
- ✅ API endpoints working (200/405 status codes)
- ✅ Stripe integration detected
- ✅ Nexus TechHub branding visible
- ✅ UAE phone number showing
- ✅ AED currency displaying
- ✅ Webhook endpoint working

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If Environment Variables Don't Take Effect**
1. **Clear Netlify cache**: Deploy settings → Clear cache and deploy
2. **Check variable names**: Ensure exact spelling and no extra spaces
3. **Verify deployment**: Check deploy logs for environment variable loading

### **If API Endpoints Still Fail**
1. **Check Netlify Functions**: Ensure serverless functions are deploying
2. **Review build logs**: Look for compilation errors
3. **Verify file structure**: Ensure pages/api/ directory structure is correct

### **If Stripe Integration Still Missing**
1. **Check NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**: Must start with "pk_live_"
2. **Verify client-side loading**: Check browser console for errors
3. **Test checkout page**: Visit /enhanced-checkout directly

- ✅ Mobile experience optimized

## ⏰ **Timeline**

**Total Time to Fix**: 15-20 minutes
- Environment Variables: 10 minutes

- Verification: 5 minutes

**Expected Completion**: Within 30 minutes of starting

## 📞 **Support Information**

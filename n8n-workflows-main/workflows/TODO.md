# TODO: Optimize "Update Current Stock1" Node in RepairDesk Workflow

## Approved Plan
- Add input validation directly in the "Update Current Stock1" node or preceding code node to ensure all required fields are present and valid.
- Add error handling to catch and log any failures during the Google Sheets update operation.
- Integrate Sentry error logging if configured in environment variables.
- Optimize performance by caching repeated lookups if possible (e.g., product ID existence).
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient Google Sheets API errors.
- Ensure the node updates related systems if applicable (e.g., trigger ticket or invoice updates).
- Confirm environment variables (API keys, Sentry DSN) are used securely.
- Provide clear success and error messages in the workflow output.
- Optionally, batch updates if multiple stock items are updated simultaneously (ask if needed).

## Logical Steps
1. Review current "Update Current Stock1" node configuration in 3979_workflow_3979.json.
2. Add input validation code node before "Update Current Stock1" to validate required fields (e.g., Product ID, Updated Current Stock, Material Name).
3. Modify "Update Current Stock1" node to include error handling and retry logic.
4. Add Sentry integration for error logging.
5. Add HTTP Request node to call Nexus API (/inventory/updatetradein/{id}) after stock update.
6. Ensure environment variables for API_BASE_URL and API_KEY are used.
7. Test the optimized workflow with sample data.
8. Update workflow documentation if needed.

- **Modern CSS techniques** (gradients, transforms, cubic-bezier easing)

### Interactive Features
- **Pause-on-hover** for better user control
- **Progress indicators** for clear navigation feedback
- **Staggered animations** for engaging content reveals
- **Enhanced button states** for better interaction feedback

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### New Files Created:
- `utils/useIntersectionObserver.js` - Intersection Observer hook
- `components/animations/FadeIn.js` & `FadeIn.module.css`
- `components/animations/SlideIn.js` & `SlideIn.module.css`
- `components/animations/StaggerList.js` & `StaggerList.module.css`

### Files Enhanced:
- `components/FeaturedProducts/FeaturedProducts.js` - Swiper carousel
- `components/FeaturedProducts/FeaturedProducts.module.css` - Carousel styling
- `components/Hero/Hero.js` - Pause-on-hover and progress indicators
- `components/Hero/Hero.module.css` - Enhanced button animations
- `pages/finance.js` - Scroll-triggered animations integration

## ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS
The foundation for site-wide interactivity has been established. The next logical steps would be:

1. **Skeleton Loading Screens** - Create loading state components
2. **Enhanced Accordion Animations** - Update UnifiedFooter accordions
3. **Advanced Slider Features** - Add progress bars and better touch gestures
4. **Global Animation Styles** - Update styles/globals.css with keyframe animations

## ðŸ’¡ IMPACT
These enhancements significantly improve:
- **User engagement** through smooth, professional animations
- **Perceived performance** with loading states and smooth transitions
- **Accessibility** with reduced motion support and proper ARIA labels
- **Mobile experience** with touch-optimized interactions
- **Brand consistency** through cohesive animation language

The implementation follows modern web development best practices and provides a solid foundation for future interactive enhancements.
